In connection with the Service, we request and display some Personal Information to other users and visitors of the Service, to enable users to identify each other.</p>
      <p>The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to interact with other users, improving the content of the Service, developing and enhancing our product offerings, managing our business and operations, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features and administering your user account. We may also draw upon this Personal Information in order to adapt the Services, to research the effectiveness of our Service, and to develop new tools for the Services and new services. </p>
      <p>Hipsell also uses personal and other information and data that is collected in an aggregated and anonymized manner, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally, to improve the Service, product offerings and to administer our business.  We reserve the right to use, disclose, sell, trade or rent data aggregated provided that such data is not linked to any specific individual. </p>
      <p>The Service allows you to connect with certain third party services. When you broadcast information to such third party services, such information is no longer under the control of Hipsell and is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of such third parties. </p>

      <h3>Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>
      <p>The Service is designed to help you share information, including your location, with others. You can control the disclosure of your personal information through your privacy settings. Information you submit to the Service will be available to users of the Service and third parties accessing the Service in accordance with the selected privacy settings. This is primarily so your friends can find you and send a meeting invitation. </p>
      <p>Please remember that if you choose to provide Personal Information using certain features of the Service, that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and, unless selected otherwise, may be available to a broad group Hipsell users or may be published on the Hipsell website, which is subject to indexing by third party search engines. Individuals reading this information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. </p>
      <p>We enter into relationships with a variety of businesses and partners who we may share your Personal Information with, unless you have elected not to be solicited by marketing partners during the registration process or through the account settings page. These businesses may be in the business of selling or promoting goods or services and they may communicate with you or provide promotions to you through the Service.  Additionally, as part of the Service you may be exposed to offers from Hipsell on behalf of other businesses. However, in connection with such offers we do not give the other business your name, address, or email address.</p>
      <p>To be able to serve you, your Personal Information may be collected, stored and/or processed or otherwise used by or on our or your behalf both inside and outside of Canada by third party service providers or partners to perform certain functions.

In all such circumstances Hipsell will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an agreement from any potential purchaser to maintain the confidentiality of your Personal Information and only use it as permitted by law. Moreover, in the unlikely event that Hipsell goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Hipsell or the assets of Hipsell may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>
      <p>We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with any applicable law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Hipsell, our employees, our users or others. </p>
